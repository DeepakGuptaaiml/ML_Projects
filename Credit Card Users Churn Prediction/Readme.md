# Background & Context
The Thera bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card, credit cards are a good source of income for banks because of different kinds of fees charged by the banks like annual fees, balance transfer fees, and cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, and others. Some fees are charged to every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.

Customers’ leaving credit card services would lead the bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and the reason for same – so that the bank could improve upon those areas

You as a Data Scientist at Thera Bank need to come up with a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards

You need to identify the best possible model that will give the required performance

# Business Objective
  1. Explore and visualize the dataset.
  2. Build a classification model to predict if the customer is going to churn or not
  3. Optimize the model using appropriate techniques
  4. Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the bank

# Data Dictionary:
  - CLIENTNUM: Client number. Unique identifier for the customer holding the account
  - Attrition_Flag: Internal event (customer activity) variable - if the account is closed then "Attrited Customer" else "Existing Customer"
  - Customer_Age: Age in Years
  - Gender: Gender of the account holder
  - Dependent_count: Number of dependents
  - Education_Level:  Educational Qualification of the account holder - Graduate, High School, Unknown, Uneducated, College(refers to a college student), Post-Graduate, Doctorate.
  - Marital_Status: Marital Status of the account holder
  - Income_Category: Annual Income Category of the account holder
  - Card_Category: Type of Card
  - Months_on_book: Period of relationship with the bank
  - Total_Relationship_Count: Total no. of products held by the customer
  - Months_Inactive_12_mon: No. of months inactive in the last 12 months
  - Contacts_Count_12_mon: No. of Contacts between the customer and bank in the last 12 months
  - Credit_Limit: Credit Limit on the Credit Card
  - Total_Revolving_Bal: The balance that carries over from one month to the next is the revolving balance
  - Avg_Open_To_Buy: Open to Buy refers to the amount left on the credit card to use (Average of last 12 months)
  - Total_Trans_Amt: Total Transaction Amount (Last 12 months)
  - Total_Trans_Ct: Total Transaction Count (Last 12 months)
  - Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1: Ratio of the total transaction count in 4th quarter and the total transaction count in 1st quarter
  - Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1: Ratio of the total transaction amount in 4th quarter and the total transaction amount in 1st quarter
  - Avg_Utilization_Ratio: Represents how much of the available credit the customer spent
  - Preprocessing
  - The gender information is mapped to numerical values (1 for Male, 0 for Female) to facilitate model training. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to visualize the distribution of data using count plots and distribution plots.

# Model Training
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and three machine learning models are trained: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The accuracy of each model is evaluated using the test set.

# Note
   - The models' performance metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, are provided in the Jupyter notebook.
   - Make sure to have the necessary datasets in the specified file path.
   - Adjustments to the dataset path or other parameters may be needed based on your local environment.

Feel free to explore and enhance the project further based on your requirements.
